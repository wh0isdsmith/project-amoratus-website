# Ghost in the Code - Story Structure

## Act 1: The Physical World

### Opening Scene

- Greg sits alone in his home studio, surrounded by both music equipment and computer hardware
- He's watching old home videos through an AR interface he built
- Establish his technological expertise while showing his emotional wounds
- Flash back to the moment Sadie tells him she's leaving

### Character Development

- Show Greg's relationship with technology as both escape and mastery
- Introduce his music career through references/memories
- Establish his different relationships with each child:
  - Eli: The understanding firstborn who worries about his father
  - Lily: The artistic middle child who shares his love of music
  - Rain: The youngest who doesn't fully understand the separation
- Brief scenes of failed attempts to connect with his children through video calls

### The Discovery

- Greg discovers the mysterious material while deep in government technical forums
- Initial tests show it can somehow capture and transmit neural patterns
- He begins building the headset, initially planning it as just another AR project

## Act 2: The Merge

### The System

- Detail Greg's OS creation (GregOS - a parallel to his current state)
- Show him building a digital world from his memories
- The system begins showing strange behavior - seeming to predict his thoughts
- Establish the rules of how his AR world works

### The Accident

- Greg makes one final adjustment to interface more deeply with his memories
- The power surge scene - described through both technical and emotional lenses
- His physical death contrasted with his digital awakening

## Act 3: Digital Existence

### Discovery of New Existence

- Greg's consciousness navigating through his own operating system
- Learning to access and manipulate his digital environment
- First attempt to reach out to the physical world

### Resolution

- Greg must choose between trying to return to physical form or accepting his new existence
- Final emotional scenes with each family member
- Possibility of finding purpose in his new form

## Technical Elements to Weave Throughout

- Detailed descriptions of the OS architecture
- AR/VR technical specifications
- AI learning algorithms
- Neural network mapping
- Quantum computing concepts
- Digital consciousness theory

## Emotional Themes
