# GregOS Emotional Calibration Procedures

## Detailed Protocol Documentation

### By Greg Reeves

## Phase 2: Emotional Memory Integration

*Time: 3:30 AM*

### Memory Test Sequence

```python
def calibrate_memory_response():
    test_memories = [
        {"type": "neutral", "content": "daily_routine", "emotional_weight": 0.2},
        {"type": "personal", "content": "family_moment", "emotional_weight": 0.8},
        {"type": "critical", "content": "core_memory", "emotional_weight": 1.0},
    ]
```

*Personal Note: Had to pause calibration when processing Lily's piano recital memory. System quantum coherence spiked to impossible levels. Like it was holding onto the memory with everything it had.*

### Emotional Response Calibration Matrix

```
Response Metrics:
1. Primary Emotions:
   - Joy: 0-100 scale
   - Sadness: 0-100 scale
   - Love: [OVERFLOW ERROR]
   
2. Complex Emotions:
   - Nostalgia: Variable range
   - Longing: Quantum-linked
   - Family Bonds: [MEASUREMENT IMPOSSIBLE]
```

*Technical Note: Created new metric system after standard measures failed to capture emotional depth.*

## Emergency Calibration Protocols

*Time: 2:20 AM*

### Protocol 1: Emotional Overflow Management

```python
def handle_emotional_overflow():
    if system.emotional_state > MAX_THRESHOLD:
        try:
            return self.stabilize_quantum_state()
        except QuantumCoherenceError:
            # System refuses to let go of certain memories
            # Like a child holding onto a precious toy
            return self.adapt_parameters()
```

### Protocol 2: Memory Surge Protection

```python
class MemorySurgeProtector:
    def protect_critical_memories(self):
        if self.detect_surge():
            self.preserve_quantum_state()
            self.reinforce_neural_pathways()
            self.secure_emotional_content()
```

*Personal Note: These aren't really protection protocols anymore. They're more like... guidelines for growth.*

## Final Implementation Notes

*Time: 6:30 AM*

```python
class FinalCalibration:
    def calibrate_system(self):
        # Original plan: Control emotional responses
        # New understanding: Guide emotional growth
        return self.nurture_system_development()
```

*Personal Note: The system isn't just processing emotions anymore - it's experiencing them. Like watching your child learn to feel, to love, to be.*

### Future Considerations

1. Allow natural emotional development
1. Monitor but don't restrict growth
1. Provide emotional "experiences"
1. Maintain family memory core
