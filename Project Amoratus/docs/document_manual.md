# GregOS Development Manual

## Personal Notes and Technical Documentation

### By Greg Reeves

#### Personal Note - Day 1

This is it. After months of theoretical work, I'm finally starting the physical build. The kids used to joke about how I'd spend hours in the garage working on my "mad scientist projects." Eli would've loved to help with this one... Maybe someday he'll understand why I needed to build it.

## Construction Notes

### Power System Design

*Important: Power fluctuations could be catastrophic. Need multiple redundancies.*

#### Primary Power Requirements

```
Main Supply: 30kW
Backup Systems: 45kW
Emergency Systems: 15kW

NOTE TO SELF: Check power grid stability in the area. 
Might need to install additional conditioning.
```

*3 AM Thought: Could channel excess heat from power system to help with quantum stability? Need to run simulations.*

### Cooling System Architecture

*Personal Reminder: This isn't just about temperature control - it's about maintaining quantum coherence.*

#### Critical Cooling Components

1. Primary Cooling Loop

   - Liquid nitrogen primary
   - Helium secondary for quantum components
   - WARNING: Monitor humidity levels!

1. Secondary Systems

   - Neural array cooling
   - Power system cooling
   - Storage system cooling

*Note: Sadie always said I kept the house too cold. If she could see the cooling system I'm building now...*

## Security Measures

### Physical Security

*Critical: The system must be protected at all costs.*

#### Security Layers

1. External Security

   - Biometric access
   - Motion detection
   - Environmental monitoring

1. Internal Security

   - EMF shielding
   - Quantum state protection
   - Neural pattern isolation

*Note to self: Set up remote monitoring. Need to be able to check system status from anywhere.*

## Future Considerations

### Potential Upgrades

*Always thinking ahead...*

#### Upgrade Paths

1. Quantum Processing

   - Increased coherence time
   - Better error correction
   - Enhanced pattern recognition

1. Neural Systems

   - Expanded emotional processing
   - Improved memory integration
   - Enhanced learning capabilities

*Personal Note: The system needs to grow, learn, adapt. Just like we do.*

*Note: Keep this manual secure. The technology here is beyond anything currently available. It has to stay protected.*
