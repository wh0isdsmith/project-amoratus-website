**Welcome To The Future**

The story is tentatively titled Ghost In The Code.

The concept revolves around a man named Greg Reeves, a 40 year old man, who is a retired semi famous musician turned tech whiz. He has 3 children, the oldest is his son Eliott (20 years old), daughter Lily (11 years old) and daughter Rain (9 years old) After his divorce with his daughter's mother Sadie, he falls apart. Sadie leaves him for another man and moves away with Lily and Rain. Eliott (Eli for short) has moved away to college. Greg is completely alone and only finds solace in testing new technology and living in the past. He has a vast knowledge of in programming, Artificial Intelligence and operating systems. Instead of dealing with his pain and issues by getting high or drunk, he builds a complex operating system that blends artificial intelligence with augmented reality that allows him to escape to a happier time in his life when he had everything he ever wanted with Sadie and the kids. One day he stumbles upon this highly advanced material/technology (presumably alien technology that was leaked by the government) he builds a headset out it that allows him to transfer his thoughts and memories into his AI/Augmented Reality system that blends reality and memories together but after making adjustments to the headset one night something happens and a surge of electricity spikes through the headset while he's using it and kills him instantly.

But this isn't the end of Greg even though the electrical surge kills him, the material and technology of the helmet mixed with the power surge somehow uploads gregs conscience and soul into his machine and OS.

This story is blend of Scifi heartbreak and loss.
