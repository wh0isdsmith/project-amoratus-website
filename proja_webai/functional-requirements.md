# Functional Requirements Document: Project Amoratus Website

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the functional requirements for the Project Amoratus website. It describes the features, functionalities, and technical specifications necessary to create the desired user experience, immersing visitors in the world of Greg Reeves and his sentient memory system.

### 1.2 Scope

This document covers the functional requirements for the initial release (MVP) of the Project Amoratus website. It includes descriptions of the core features, user interactions, and content structure. It does not cover non-functional requirements like performance and security in detail, but these will be addressed during the development process. Future enhancements beyond the MVP are outlined briefly but will be detailed in separate documents.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is intended for the development team, including the frontend developer, AI assistants (Gemini and Copilot), and any potential future collaborators. It will also serve as a reference for stakeholders interested in understanding the project's functionality.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

### 2.2 User Classes and Characteristics

*   **Casual Visitors:** Individuals interested in science fiction, technology, and emotionally driven narratives. They may not be highly technical but are curious about the project and its story. Their goal is to explore the website, learn about Project Amoratus, and enjoy an engaging experience.
*   **Tech Enthusiasts:** Users with a deeper interest in technology, particularly quantum computing, neural networks, and AR/VR. They are interested in the technical details of the project and how it is presented. Their goal is to understand the fictional technologies and how they relate to real-world concepts.
*   **Story Lovers:** Individuals drawn to compelling narratives, particularly those exploring themes of love, loss, memory, and consciousness. They are interested in Greg's story and the emotional impact of his creation. Their goal is to connect with the characters and experience the emotional depth of the narrative.

### 2.3 Operating Environment

*   **Platform:** Web-based application.
*   **Accessibility:** Strive to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions).

### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints

*   **Development Environment:** Local development environment using Node.js and npm.
*   **Technology Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS, Context API, `fetch` API.
*   **AI Assistants:**
    *   Gemini will be used for architectural guidance, brainstorming, and content generation.
    *   Copilot will be used for code completion, refactoring, and generating boilerplate code.
*   **Performance:** Aim for fast loading times and smooth transitions between pages and interactive elements.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

*   **Assumption:** The content for the website (text, images, diagrams) will be provided or generated based on the existing documentation.
*   **Dependency:** The website relies on the accuracy and completeness of the existing Project Amoratus documentation.
